Characters advance when they act according to their role. For instance, a CRUSADER advances if they behaved ethically during the course of a mission. If you feel you’ve reached natural closure for your role, you can choose a new one between missions. If a player advances, they can choose one reward: 1.) a new trait, 2.) +1D6 MAX HP, 3.) +1D6 WAR DICE.

Players who choose new traits are encouraged to narrate how they got them, in order to add some personal flavor. For instance, a player who chose the ILLUSION trait could explain that they used a sensory deprivation tank to activate latent psychic abilities, or that they constructed a swarm of holographic projection drones. Feel free to reskin traits, too—maybe your SHOW performer is actually a warrior- poet, or your PARKOUR gives you a golf club.
