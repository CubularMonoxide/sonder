Combat works the same as doing anything else risky. Roll the dice to attack, and deal the damage listed for your weapon if you succeed. If you're being attacked, roll the dice to avoid, counter, etc. Rolling a failure in **active combat** always incurs damage. If you take damage, subtract it from your HP. If you take damage while wearing armor, subtract the ARMOR bonus from the damage dealt. HP is precious, so stealth, guerilla warfare, and creative thinking are necessary for survival. If your HP drops to 0, you're dead - there are no saving throws in war, my friend. Log your death somewhere the whole table can see (a "character graveyard"), then make a new merc and prepare for **emergency insertion**.
