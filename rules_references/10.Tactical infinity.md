For any reason, at any time, you can try any tactic to solve any problem. The ideas and mechanics which comprise this game are there to provide support and context for what tactics you consider (and which ones will work), but you are not limited by themâ€”this is the beauty of tabletop RPGs, their infinite possibility space. For this reason, much of FIST is written with the assumption that the rules are incomplete; they cannot realistically cover every fictional situation which could occur in the world your table creates. Remember: you can always think outside the box!
