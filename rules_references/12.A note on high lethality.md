War is hell, and death is cheap in FIST. While your characters may have ultrahuman skills, abilities, and experience, they are not immune to the business end of a rifle. FIST operatives are typically outnumbered, outgunned, and underfunded, lacking the resources and support of a state agency or private military contractor. You will not be able to win every fight, and active combat is never your only option.
