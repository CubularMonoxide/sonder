Once per mission, the team can agree to send out a **rendezvous signal**. Upon the signal's activation, the referee will describe a nearby rendezvous point (such as a janitor closet or abandoned building) and the obstacles to reaching it. As long as the players remain at the rendezvous point (which is typically out-of-the-way, easily defensible, and stocked with common supplies), they are safe. Each player at the point may choose one of the following bonuses:
- **REST:** Recover 1D6 HP.
- **RESTOCK:** Refill one limited-use item.
- **INTEL:** Receive one useful fact about the mission from the referee.
