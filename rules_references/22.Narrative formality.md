If you're primarily familiar with fantasy adventure roleplaying games, you may expect the "dungeon master" to speak in sweeping, well-considered bits of prose (e.g., "Something formless and hateful bubbles up from the musty, oppressive darkness around you."). While purple prose can often be a perfect fit for the tongue- in-cheek seriousness of FIST, there's nothing wrong with keeping it casual to maintain the pace, sell the theme, and set the tone. You might say, "She pulls up and gets out of her car; she has a James Bond thing going on," or, "You absolutely blow his brains out," or, "Okay... the shadows are fucking moving, what now?"
