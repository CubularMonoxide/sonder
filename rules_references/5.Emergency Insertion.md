Dying in the middle of a mission doesn't mean you have to sit back and watch everyone else play. While the mission continues, you can create a new operative and describe how they'll be inserted into the mission - perhaps as a plant, through a helicopter airdrop, or by using an experimental teleporter. Wait for the referee to clear you for entry, then roll on the emergency insertion table (p. 2) to jump in. Be aware that you may face complications while attempting to join your team.

## Emergency Insertion Table
If your character dies, create a fresh character while play continues. When you're ready to deploy, jump into the fray and roll 2D6:
- **6 OR LESS:** Deployment goes wrong somehow.
- **7-9:** Deploy normally.
- **10 OR ABOVE:** Deploy with an extra standard issue item.
- **DOUBLE SIXES:** As above, and +3 to your first roll.
