FIST campaigns are framed as a series of missions which usually last a single play session. Sometimes, the missions fall into an overarching plot or grand conspiracy. Other times, they’re just one-off jobs. Periodically, the mission might be unpaid and done for personal reasons, like squaring off with an old nemesis, tracking down a useful asset for a future goal, or making amends for past mistakes.

Player characters start each mission at full HP with all limited-use items refilled, and any lost trait-granted or standard-issue items replaced or returned. Any other items carry over between missions, but are lost if left behind. WAR DICE are single-use and don’t refill. Paid jobs are just a framing device in FIST, so don’t worry too much about supply costs.
