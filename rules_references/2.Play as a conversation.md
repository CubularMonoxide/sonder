FIST functions like a conversation between the players and the referee. The referee narrates the environment, characters, and story the players are  interacting  with.  The  players  respond  by  asking  the  referee  for details, talking to characters they encounter, and narrating their own actions in the fictional world. When the outcome of those actions is uncertain, the players roll the dice to find out what happens next. 

FIST is light on bookkeeping and number-crunching, and doesn’t have formal turns split up into a certain amount of actions. Players will take turns talking amongst each other and to the referee, but mostly in the same way they would in a natural conversation. Sometimes, you’ll be in the spotlight describing something cool, complex, or confusing. Other times, you’ll step out of the spotlight to let other players do the same.
