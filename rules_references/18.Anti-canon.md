There is no one correct FIST game world, and if there was, it certainly wouldn't be locked up in the back room at CLAYMORE. Many sections in this book state or imply certain things about the setting, but these are provided as tools and seasonings for your game, not hard truths. The world you create at your table through roleplay when you say, "This is worse than the Budapest job," or "You know, I helped JFK slay a vampire," or "My character is from Mars," is more real than anything in this book.
