In FIST, it is the referee’s job to maintain a fictional world that responds to your actions. For this reason, it is important to consider your team’s place in this world as they move from mission to mission. If civilians witness you assassinating a British politician now, you are likely to be harassed by MI6 in the future (even if you explain that she was a body- snatcher, and that it was an MI6 contact who hired you to whack her in the first place). FIST is not well-liked by the global intelligence community and military-industrial complex, and they are certainly not needed—you are unlikely to be hired directly by a government or large corporation unless they have some ulterior motive or have exhausted their in-house paranormal research and defense options. Rogue ultrahuman actors are an intolerable risk to the status quo, and the system is not your friend.
