Instead of playing as a mercenary, the referee plays as the game world itself. If you're planning to be the referee for your FIST game, you should familiarize yourself with the player section (p. 1) before reading on. If you're a player, you might like to read this section before going on a mission to better understand how FIST works under the hood. Nothing in this section is a secret from the players, and vice versa - the players and the referee are the custodians of two reactive compounds which only tell a whole story when combined and allowed to brew.

As the referee, your job is something like that of a showrunner. Everyone at the table will be doing some acting, writing, and directing, but you make sure that the universe stays consistent, the pacing stays brisk, and that all the right pieces are in place for the show to begin. You're also like the code of a computer game: it's your job to generate content, distribute rewards, enforce rules, and provide a responsive world.
