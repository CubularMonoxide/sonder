Subterfuge aside, your greatest hope lies in other people. Some referee- controlled characters may offer insider information in exchange for protection, others may join you in battle as powerful allies. Even if a character has nothing to offer you, FIST is a conversation game, and talking is always a free action. Feel free to stop a fight and challenge your enemy's ideology, or take a breather to map out an infiltration strategy with your fellow players. Coordinating with your teammates can give you a tactical edge - more people can cover more bases at once. There's also no rule against making brand new FIST operatives perfectly suited for the challenge at hand. The world is your oyster.
