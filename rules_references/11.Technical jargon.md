Finally, here are some terms and abbreviations which are likely to come up during play.
- Attributes are sometimes abbreviated like so: **FRC** for FORCEFUL, **TAC** for TACTICAL, **CRE** for CREATIVE, and **RFX** for REFLEXIVE.
- Rolling **D66** (instead of 2D6) or **D666** (instead of 3D6) means rolling multiple six-sided dice in a specific order and using the numbers shown as the digits in your result. For instance, a D66 roll of 2 and 4 would be 24, not 6. A D666 roll of 5, 2, and 1 would be 521.
- Sometimes the likelihood of an event is expressed as **X-in-1D6**. This means you should roll 1D6 and treat the associated information as true if the result is less than or equal to X, and false if it's above X.
- **Best-of-XD6** and **worst-of-XD6** are used as shorthand for rolling XD6 and dropping the lowest die (best-of), or the highest die (worst-of).
- Some items list a number of **uses** (also called **limited-use** items), and others are marked as **consumable**. Items which list a number of uses are unavailable when their uses have been exhausted, but always remain in your inventory. Consumable items can only be used once, after which they are gone forever (or until you find more).
- **PC** and **NPC** stand for "player character" and "non-player character."
